# Fell Down Well

[Download and play from itch.io](https://alphaaxle.itch.io/fell-down-well)

Unity project for the OSU Game Creation Club's 2018 Fall Game Jam, created in 48 hours

The theme for the game jam was "You may be wondering how I got in this situation". I chose to answer this question in the title, as you play as a character trying to get out of the well you fell into.
